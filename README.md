Project Name: Lab 2 / Course Syllabus\
This repository satisfies questions 5 (Course Syllabus) and 6 (RegExp Tester).\
In this project, I used information from the Software Engineering course syllabus to the Course Syllabus\
page. It is a copy of the information.\
The following are required build files: index.html and regexp.html\
The Course Syllabus page displays very basic information about this Software Engineering course.\
The regexp.html is an attachment to the Course Syllabus page and tests to see if the string and \
expression are valid when used together.\
